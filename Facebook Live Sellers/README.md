_-- Posts done during the weekends have a better reaction rates than posts done on weekdays.
_-- A post that is loved or liked has a higher probability of being shared.

- Limitations:
- Two main limitations of this project are as follows:

_-- It was not possible to tell te actual post that was done. For instance, it could be that more reactions were made on a photo/video of particular type of fashion or cosmetic product. Specific type of a product could have a bearing on the engagement rate of the post.
_-- The data did not provide the variable for the retailers. This might have helped to understand whether a retailer had an influence on the engagement rates of their posts.
